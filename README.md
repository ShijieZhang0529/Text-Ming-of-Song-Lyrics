# Project 1: Text Mining of Song Lyrics

<img src="figs/title1.jpeg" width="500">

### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

+ This project is conducted by *Shijie Zhang*.

+ Project summary: In this project, I apply text mining and natural language processing techniques to get insight into the characteristics of different types of song lyrics. Once I compare the lyrics of songs in distinct music genres, I identify several interesting patterns on their sentiments, topics and content length. Intriguingly, more inspiration is derived by relating the lyrics’ sentiments with the music history.
