## Project Description

You can find the complete project description [here](doc/Proj1_desc.md). 

This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. This project is conducted by **Shijie Zhang**.



## Project Summary

In this project, I apply text mining and natural language processing techniques to get insight into the characteristics of different types of song lyrics. Once I compare the lyrics of songs in distinct music genres, I identify several interesting patterns on their sentiments, topics and content length. Intriguingly, more inspiration is derived by relating the lyrics’ sentiments with the music history.
